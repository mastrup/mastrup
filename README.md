### Hi there 👋🏻
 I'm Søren - a senior web developer with over 13 years of experience and a proven track record of leading technical teams in enterprise environments.

For more than a decade I've specialised in Umbraco and .NET based solutions, leading development from planning to production. I manage external developers, coordinate cross-functional work and ensure delivery stays on track - all with a focus on code quality and maintainability.

My expertise includes infrastructure as code with Terraform and Pulumi (TypeScript), CI/CD with Azure DevOps, and backend development in C#. I'm hands-on, but always focused on the bigger picture: scalable architecture, team efficiency, and delivering business value.
